# Sandpack Runtime

**Sandpack Runtime** is a lightweight environment for running and managing dynamic code projects in the browser. It allows real-time execution of JavaScript and TypeScript files, isolates execution in an `iframe`, and enables easy communication between the runtime and your application, making it ideal for interactive code editors and web playgrounds.
